    <h1>Miso Eggplant</h1>

    <h2>What is chashu?</h2>
    <p>Eggplant is easily one of those under-appreciated and misapprehend 
        vegetables. Mainly because it can be tricky to cook. However, 
        when it's done right, this spongy vegetable has the ability to soak up flavors and offers the best silky, sumptuous texture.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Japanese eggplants (~1.2lbs/518g)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><u>For the Sweet Miso Glaze</u></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp shiro (white) miso</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1/2-1 Tbsp sake (or water)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Garnish (Optional)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1-2 scallion (depending on size)</li>
        <li>5 shiso leaves (perilla/ooba)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Set the oven rack in the center of the oven about 7 inches (18 cm) away from the heating element. Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).</li>
        <li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To Make the Sweet Miso Glaze</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the miso and sugar. Mix well until sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the mirin and gradually add the sake to your preferred consistency (some miso might be chunkiern than others). Mix well and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To Prepare the Eggplants</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off the stem and calyx of the eggplants and cut them in half lengthwise from the stem to the tip. If your eggplants are long, you can cut them in half widthwise.</li>
        <li>With a knife, score the eggplant flesh diagonally in one direction and then the other, creating a crisscross pattern. The cuts should be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) deep. Scoring the eggplant in this way helps the eggplants cook faster and improves presentation.</li>
        <li>Soak the eggplants in water for 10 minutes to remove any astringency. Blot the eggplants with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel to dry them.</li>
        <li>Brush the eggplant flesh with sesame oil before putting them flesh-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil.</li>
        <li>Bake the eggplants at 425ºF (220ºC) for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While these are baking, prepare the green onions by cutting them into thin rounds.</li>
        <li>Prepare the shiso leaves by rolling them into a cylinder before cutting them into julienned strips.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, check that the eggplant skin is beginning to shrivel and the flesh is soft. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Now, change the oven setting and preheat the broiler. <b>Keep the oven rack in the center of the oven,</b> roughly 7 inches (18 cm) away from the heating element.</li>
        <li>Carefully turn the eggplants over and brush them enough sweet miso glaze to coat the surface completely. Depending on the size of your eggplants, you may have glaze left over. The original recipe makes enough glaze for 3 large or 5 medium eggplants. You can freeze it for later use or use it as a vegetable dip.</li>
        <li>Place the eggplants under the broiler for 3-5 minutes, or until the glaze begins to bubble. Cooking times vary based on the distance between the baking sheet and the heating element.</li>
        <li>Before serving, add the garnishes. Sprinkle the baked eggplants with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onion, and shiso leaves.</li>
    </ol>
