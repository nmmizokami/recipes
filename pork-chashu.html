    <h1>Pork Chashu</h1>
    <img src="images/chashu.jpg" alt="Japanese chashu">
    <h2>What is chashu?</h2>
    <p>Typically served with ramen,  chashu is
        pork braised in a soy sauce base.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe calls for pork belly, which has an even 
        fat distribution that, when rendered properly, leads to
        a melt in your mouth texture. I usually buy a large slab
        of pork belly from Costco and freeze whatever portion
        I'm not using.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.8-2.2lbs / 0.8-1kg pork belly</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sake</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2-3 scallions</li>
        <li>1 knob of ginger (about 20g/0.7oz)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take pork belly out of fridge 30 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>Cover pork with plastic wrap and tenderize by pounding it with a rolling pin or meat mallet</li>
        <li>Season the pork with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roll the slab of pork belly into a cylindrical shape.</li>
        <li>Tie up pork belly tightly with cooking string so the meat holds its shape.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in frying pan and brown the outside of the pork belly on all sides (including the rolled up edges)</li>
        <li>Transfer pork belly into simmering water (water not included in ingredients list). You need 
            enough water to just cover the pork belly. Cook for one hour over low heat.</li>
        <li>Skim the excess fat that accumulates on the surface of the water. This will remove
            the unpleasant odors and flavors from the pork belly.</li>
        <li>Drain the water, leaving the pork belly in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, sake, soy sauce, water, scallions, ginger, and garlic into the pot, bringing it to
            a boil before turning down the heat to low. Place a drop lid (otoshibuta) over the ingredients and 
            simmer for one hour.</li>
    </ol>
